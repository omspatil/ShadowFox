## About the Internship
As a Python Development Intern at ShadowFox, I worked on multiple projects that honed my skills in Python programming, web scraping, data analysis, and interactive game development. I also practiced data extraction on various websites and completed several intermediate-level tasks, including comprehensive data analysis using Python libraries.

## Tasks Completed

### Web Scraping Project
I developed a web scraper to extract data from websites using Beautiful Soup and Scrapy. The project involved:
- Handling errors and exceptions.
- Saving the scraped data in a structured format.
- Ensuring efficient and accurate data extraction.

### Interactive Hangman Game
I created an interactive Hangman game using Python, HTML, and CSS. The game features:
- Visual progress indicators for the player.
- Win/loss conditions.
- Replay options for continuous gameplay.

### Data Analysis with Python
I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Diwali sales dataset using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis involved:
- Importing and cleaning the dataset.
- Performing data manipulations and transformations.
- Visualizing key insights, such as gender distribution, age group purchases, state-wise orders, marital status, occupation, and product category analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS
- **Web Scraping Frameworks:** Beautiful Soup, Scrapy
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Data Formats:** JSON, CSV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-development-internship-shadowfox.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python-development-internship-shadowfox
    ```

## Usage
- To run the web scraper, navigate to the scraper directory and execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python web_scraper.py
    ```
- To play the Hangman game, navigate to the hangman directory and execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
- To perform data analysis, navigate to the data_analysis directory and run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb
    ```

This repository showcases my journey and the skills I acquired during my internship at ShadowFox. I am eager to apply these skills to future projects and continue learning and growing in the field of Python development.
